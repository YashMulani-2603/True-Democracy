              <p style="color:black"> IRS officer, who demanded dismissal of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, suspended.
                  Two days before he was set to retire, Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer B Balamurugan from Tamil Nadu, who had demanded the dismissal of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over an ED case, was suspended by the Union Ministry of Finance on Monday.

As per reports, Balamurugan was scheduled to retire on Wednesday.

Balamurugan, who served as Deputy Commissioner of GST and CEx, Chennai (North), wrote to President Droupadi Murmu earlier in January seeking the dismissal of Union Minister Sitharaman for ?converting the ED into an extended arm of BJP?. The officer had written to President Murmu over the July 2023 Enforcement Directorate summons to two Dalit farmers in Tamil Nadu?s Salem district in a case of alleged money laundering.
